LDPC Code Implementation of the G.hn ITU G9960 standard proposed by the ITU-T.
Jan 2017 â€“ Apr 2017

Project description:

The standard can be divided in two parts:

 - ENCODING

For each part different settings has been considerd. 

So far, this is the project is the one I'm most proud of because it required me to use jointly my knowledges in telecommunications, 
linear-algebra, graph mining and probability to solve a real technical problem.
